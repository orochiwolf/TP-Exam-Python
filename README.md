# QCM Application Project - Python TP for Computer Science Students

Welcome to the **QCM Application Project** repository! This project is designed to help computer science students learn and practice Python programming through the creation of a **Multiple-Choice Questionnaire (QCM) application**. It is part of a hands-on programming lab (TP) aimed at teaching essential programming concepts and project management skills.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a Python application that allows users to:

1. **Answer QCM questions**
2. **Evaluate their answers** and calculate a final score
3. **Track user history**, including previous scores and test dates
4. **Provide feedback** for correct and incorrect answers
5. Optionally implement advanced features like timers, question categories, and result exports

This repository contains all the resources, guidelines, and references needed to complete the project successfully.

## Key Features

### Required Features:
- **User Management:**
  - Register new users and track their test history
  - Display previous scores and test dates for returning users
  - Save user data in JSON or CSV format

- **Question and Answer Management:**
  - Store questions and options in a structured file (JSON or CSV)
  - Validate user answers and compute a score

- **Feedback and Scoring:**
  - Provide feedback for each question
  - Display the correct answer for incorrect responses
  - Show the final score at the end of the test

### Optional Advanced Features:
- Implement a timer for questions or the whole test
- Add categories (e.g., Python, Networks, Algorithms) for users to choose from
- Export test results to a file (CSV or text)

## Learning Objectives
This project helps students:
- Apply **Python programming concepts** (data structures, file handling, loops, functions, etc.)
- Understand the importance of **data persistence** through files
- Practice **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**
- Collaborate effectively in teams
- Learn how to document and present a project

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with concepts like lists, dictionaries, and file handling

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
2. Install any required dependencies (if applicable).

### Usage
1. Follow the instructions in the project guidelines to start the application.
2. Implement the required features step by step.
3. Test your application thoroughly.

### Deliverables
Each team should deliver:
- The **source code** of the application
- A **README** file with usage instructions and examples
- A **project report** explaining:
  - Technical choices
  - Challenges faced
  - Solutions implemented
- A **demo** showcasing the main features of the application
